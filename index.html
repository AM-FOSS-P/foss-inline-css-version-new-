 <h3 id="Intro"> Introduction </h3>
 <p id="Introduction"> <strong> Hello everyone, I hope you're all having a great day. We all know that there are many types of softwares. Some of them are free, some of them needs
                                one time purchase and some of them are subscription based. Everything is fine but as we all know that our country does not have the method of payment through PayPal
                                , it's very hard for us to buy those softwares. So, in this article, I'm going to demonstrate about the free Open Source Softwares,that are free to use 
                                for both personal and commercial purposes. As they are free to use, it would be inappropriate to compare them with Flagship softwares , especially with Adobe Softwares. In this article, I have also included learning resources,so that it becomes easy for you to learn and know about the usage of those softwares . So, without any further delay, let's dive into it
                                </strong> </p>

  GIMP (GNU Image Manipulating Program) 
   is a free Open Source Image Manipulating software           
  that has been developed by "GIMP Development Team".
  It was first introduced in 1995 at "The University of California" as a 
  semester project. After that, In 1996 , it was published publicly.
  It has been considered as the best "Adobe Photoshop" alternative.
  It has almost every features of "Adobe Photoshop" except for some features.

  <p> <strong> Now, we all know abot the good side
               and bad side of "GIMP". The good sides are 
               more than the bad side. Also don't get annoyed with 
               the bad side. "The GIMP Development Team" said that they will 
               bring the "Layer Adjustment" and the "CMYK Colour support" on their upcoming
               GIMP version 3.2. They said that it would be a "Game Changer" (Possibly break the internet!ðŸ˜‚)
               .However, the present version is GIMP 2.10.4. GIMP version 2.99 has been released for beta use that has new updated UI
               . Hoping to get the new update soon.

  Inkscape is a free Open Source Vector Illustrating Software

  Inkscape is considered as the best "Adobe Illustrator" alternative. 
  Unlike "GIMP" it has every single tool of "Adobe Illustrator".
  It only lacks of some minor features that is being hoped to come in upcoming future versions.

  <p id="conclusion"> <strong> Conclusion </strong>  </p>
  
  <p> <strong> Inkscape is really an awesome piece of software.
               If you learn every functions, then it'll be very easy for 
               you to create design freely. It's cons are very little than it's pros.
               In Inkscape version 1.0 , many features were missing.
               But the new Inkscape version 1.1 , it became really great.
               You can hope that the "CMYK format" will come in the next update.
               One of the greatest thing of Inkscape is that it's own format "SVG" . 
               No matter how much you zoom in or zoom out, the illustration will remain sharp and 
               crispy. To edit an .Ai file, you just have to change the format into .pdf 
               and then you can open and edit that in Inkscape. Many of the users asks for shape builder tool.
               It's present in the software but indirectly. However, Martin Owens , an Inkscape developer 
               said that some coders of "Google Summer Code Camp" has developed a shape builder tool for Inkscape.
               Martin said that it already looks really good. Hopefully that will come on next update.

  <p> Darktable software is a free open source raw editor for non-destructible image enhancement. It allows everyone to do basic photo editing, apply filters, and do color correction.
      First it was released for Mac but now it can be used in 
      many operating system. Windows, Linux and other OS are included.
      It can be compared with Adobe Lightroom .  </p>

  <div class="conclusion"> 
  
  <p id="conclusion"> <strong> Conclusion </strong>  </p>
  
  <p> <strong> In many alternatives of Adobe software we saw that the user interface is 
  different. It can be hard for many people who were familiar with Adobe softwares. But Darktable offers you
nearly the same user interface. So, switching from Lightroom won't be a big problem in case of navigation and usability.
Also, as it gives frequent update , you can stay in relax with the updates and features. A similar software like this is 
"Rawtherapee". It's also a same type of alternative , developed by the same group of people. But , I didn't mentioned it because
it's learning resources are limited. In some cases, you may not find them. Both of them are the same except for some small extra features.
Although, Darktable is a great RAW editor for photographers who wants to edit their shots freely.

  <p> <strong> There are many alternatives of "Adobe Premiere Pro" . But among them "DaVinci Resolve 17" is the best right now.
  It not only has basic features but also many advanced features . It has almost 90% of the features that a YouTuber or a mediocre video editor needs. 
  In the Studio or the paid version you get every features for 299$ . But usually , you will be hardly in need of those features. You won't feel the necessity of 
  those over advanced features. Overall , it's a great free video editor for almost every type of user. If you're not a movie editor than I don't think that you would need those paid version features. It needs a good 
  PC with a decent Graphics Card with 16 GB Ram and a quad core processor. In the case of learning , you have to put some effort for it. Don't get afraid of the graph editor , you will get it not instantly but surely. It's only a matter of time and effort.   </strong> </p>

  That's why, people using GIMP and Inkscape uses Krita . Also it has "Layer Adjustment" which is one of the
  best feature of Krita. Although is was not created for photo editing,but still you can edit photos in Krita. It has object removal tools like Photoshop and GIMP.
